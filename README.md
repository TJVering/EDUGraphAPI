# EDUGraphAPI - Office 365 Education Code Sample#

## What is EDUGraphAPI?##

EDUGraphAPI  is a sample that demonstrates:

* Linking local user accounts and Office 365 user accounts. 
* Calling Graph APIs, including:

  * [Microsoft Azure Active Directory Graph API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient/)
  * [Microsoft Graph API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/)

  After linking accounts, users can use either local or Office 365 accounts to log into the sample web site and use it.

* Get and show schools/sections/teachers/students from Office 365 Education:

  * [Office 365 Schools REST API reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations)

  A [Differential query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-differential-query) is used to sync data that is cached in a local database.

EDUGraphAPI is based on ASP.NET MVC. [ASP.NET Identity](https://www.asp.net/identity) is used in this project.

## Documentation

### Introduction

**EDUGraphAPI.Web**

This web project is base on a ASP.NET MVC application with the **Individual User Accounts** selected. 

![](Images/mvc-auth-individual-user-accounts.png)

The following files were created by the MVC template, and we only change them a little bit.

1. **/App_Start/Startup.Auth.Identity.cs** (The original name is Startup.Auth.cs)
2. **/Controllers/AccountController.cs**

This sample project uses [ASP.NET Identity](https://www.asp.net/identity) and [Owin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/owin). The 2 technologies make different kinds of authentication coexist easily. Please get familiar them first.

Below are the important class files used in this web project:

| File                              | Description                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| /App_Start/Startup.Auth.AAD.cs    | Integrates with Azure Active Directory authentication |
| /Controllers/AdminController.cs   | Contains the administrative actions      |
| /Controllers/LinkController.cs    | Contains the actions to link user accounts |
| /Conrrollers/SchoolsController.cs | Contains the actions to show school data |

**EDUGraphAPI.SyncData**

This is the WebJob used to sync user data.

**EDUGraphAPI.Common**

The class library project is used both the **EDUGraphAPI.Web** and **EDUGraphAPI.Common**. 

The table below shows the folders in the project:

| Folder             | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| /Data              | Contains ApplicationDbContext and entity classes |
| /DataSync          | Contains the UserSyncSerextensionsvice class which is used in the EDUGraphAPI.SyncData WebJob |
| /DifferentialQuery | Contains the DifferentialQueryService class which is used to send differential query and parse the result. |
| /Extensions        | Contains lots of extension methods which simplify coding the make code easy to read |
| /Utils             | Contains the wide used class AuthenticationHelper.cs |

**Microsoft.Education**

This project encapsulates the [Schools REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations). The most important class in this project is EducationServiceClient.
