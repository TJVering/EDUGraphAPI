# EDUGraphAPI - Office 365 Education Code Sample#

## What is EDUGraphAPI?##

EDUGraphAPI  is a sample that demonstrates:

* Linking local user accounts and Office 365 user accounts. 
* Calling Graph APIs, including:

  * [Microsoft Azure Active Directory Graph API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient/)
  * [Microsoft Graph API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/)

  After linking accounts, users can use either local or Office 365 accounts to log into the sample web site and use it.

* Get and show schools/sections/teachers/students from Office 365 Education:

  * [Office 365 Schools REST API reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations)

  A [Differential query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-differential-query) is used to sync data that is cached in a local database.

EDUGraphAPI is based on ASP.NET MVC. [ASP.NET Identity](https://www.asp.net/identity) is used in this project.

## Documentation

### Introduction

**EDUGraphAPI.Web**

This web project is base on a ASP.NET MVC application with the **Individual User Accounts** selected. 

![](Images/mvc-auth-individual-user-accounts.png)

The following files were created by the MVC template, and we only change them a little bit.

1. **/App_Start/Startup.Auth.Identity.cs** (The original name is Startup.Auth.cs)
2. **/Controllers/AccountController.cs**

This sample project uses [ASP.NET Identity](https://www.asp.net/identity) and [Owin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/owin). The 2 technologies make different kinds of authentication coexist easily. Please get familiar them first.

Below are the important class files used in this web project:

| File                              | Description                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| /App_Start/Startup.Auth.AAD.cs    | Integrates with Azure Active Directory authentication |
| /Controllers/AdminController.cs   | Contains the administrative actions      |
| /Controllers/LinkController.cs    | Contains the actions to link user accounts |
| /Controllers/SchoolsController.cs | Contains the actions to show school data |

**EDUGraphAPI.SyncData**

This is the WebJob used to sync user data.

**EDUGraphAPI.Common**

The class library project is used both the **EDUGraphAPI.Web** and **EDUGraphAPI.Common**. 

The table below shows the folders in the project:

| Folder             | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| /Data              | Contains ApplicationDbContext and entity classes |
| /DataSync          | Contains the UserSyncSerextensionsvice class which is used in the EDUGraphAPI.SyncData WebJob |
| /DifferentialQuery | Contains the DifferentialQueryService class which is used to send differential query and parse the result. |
| /Extensions        | Contains lots of extension methods which simplify coding the make code easy to read |
| /Utils             | Contains the wide used class AuthenticationHelper.cs |

**Microsoft.Education**

This project encapsulates the [Schools REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations). The most important class in this project is EducationServiceClient.

### Data Access and Data Models

ASP.NET Identity uses Entity Framework Code First to implement all of its persistence mechanism. Package [Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework/) is created for this. 

In this sample **ApplicationDbContext** is created for access data from a SQL Database. It inherited from **IdentityDbContext** which is defined in the NuGet package mentioned above.

Below are the important Data Models (and their important properties) and used in this sample:

**ApplicationUsers**

Inherited from **IdentityUser**. 

| Property      | Description                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Organization  | The tenant of the user. For local unlinked user, its value is null |
| O365UserId    | Used to connection with an Office 365 account |
| O365Email     | The Email of the linked Office 365 account |
| JobTitle      | Used for demonstrating differential query |
| Department    | Used for demonstrating differential query |
| Mobile        | Used for demonstrating differential query |
| FavoriteColor | Used for demonstrating local data        |

**Organizations**

A row in this table represents a tenant in AAD.

| Property         | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| TenantId         | Guid of the tenant                   |
| Name             | Name of the tenant                   |
| IsAdminConsented | Is the tenant consented by any admin |

### Authentication flows

There are 4 authentication flows in this project.

The first 2 flows enable users to login in with either a local account or an Office 365 account, then link to the other account.

**Local Login Authentication Flow**

**O365 Login Authentication Flow**

### Two Kinds of Graph API

![](Images/class-diagram-graphs.png)

...

### Office 365 Education Data

**EducationServiceClient**

[Office 365 Education APIs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations) help extract data from your Office 365 tenant which has been synced to the cloud by Microsoft School Data Sync. These results provide information about schools, sections, teachers, students and rosters. The Schools REST API provides access to school entities in Office 365 for Education tenants.

**Get data**

1. Get schools

   You can get all schools, get a single school by its object_id, or get a collection of schools that match a set of query filters.

   Get All schools

   [Get all schools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations#get-all-schools) that exist in the Azure Active Directory tenant.

2. Get sections

   You can [get sections](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations#get-sections-within-a-school) for a specific school by querying for groups based on their school id, using the extension_fe2174665583431c953114ff7268b7b3_Education_ObjectType attribute and the extension_fe2174665583431c953114ff7268b7b3_Education_SyncSource_SchoolId attribute together in the query.

3. Get students within a section

   Students are represented in Azure Active Directory as users. User Extension Attributes add student-specific information. For example, the extension_fe2174665583431c953114ff7268b7b3_Education_Grade attribute contains the student's grade level.

   You can [get students in a specific section](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/section-rest-operations#get-students-within-a-section), by getting the members of the sectionâ€™s unified group and filtering out non-student users from the resulting collection within your application.


### Differential query

[A differential query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-differential-query) request returns all changes made to specified entities during the time between two consecutive requests. For example, if you make a differential query request an hour after the previous differential query request, only the changes made during that hour will be returned. This functionality is especially useful when synchronizing tenant directory data with an applicationâ€™s data store.

To make a differential query request to a tenantâ€™s directory, your application must be authorized by the tenant. For more information, see [Integrating Applications with Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-integrating-applications/).
